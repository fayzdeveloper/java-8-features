# java-8-features

This tutorial comprehensively covers `Java 8 features`, with each feature housed in its `own dedicated branch`. Explore each branch independently to delve into the features along with `corresponding examples`.

# Overview of Java 8 Features

Java 8 introduced several groundbreaking features that significantly enhanced the language. This README provides a brief overview of key features.

## 1. Lambda Expressions

Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, allowing concise representation of anonymous functions. This feature enhances code readability and supports functional programming paradigms.

## 2. Stream API

The Stream API facilitates functional-style operations on collections, providing powerful tools for processing sequences of elements. It promotes a more declarative and expressive coding style.

## 3. Default Methods

Default methods enable the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. This feature enhances backward compatibility and encourages API evolution.

## 4. Functional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method. Java 8 formalized this concept, making it easier to work with lambda expressions and promoting functional programming practices.

## 5. Method References

Method references provide a shorthand syntax for lambda expressions, enhancing code conciseness. They simplify the code when a lambda expression directly calls an existing method.

## 6. Optional

The `Optional` class helps handle null values more effectively. It encourages developers to explicitly handle scenarios where a value may be absent, reducing the risk of `NullPointerExceptions`.

## 7. Date and Time API

The new Date and Time API provides a comprehensive set of classes for handling dates, times, and periods. It addresses the shortcomings of the legacy `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.

## 8. Nashorn JavaScript Engine

Nashorn is a modern JavaScript engine that comes bundled with Java 8. It allows seamless integration of JavaScript code with Java applications.

## 9. CompletableFuture

`CompletableFuture` provides a powerful mechanism for asynchronous programming. It enables composing and chaining asynchronous operations, making it easier to work with concurrent code.

## 10. Java 8 Annotations

Java 8 introduced several new annotations, such as `@FunctionalInterface` and `@Repeatable`, which enhance the expressiveness and flexibility of code.

This overview covers some of the key features introduced in Java 8. Each feature brings its own set of benefits, improving code conciseness, readability, and maintainability.
